Hints and Tricks for HW1.  More will be added.

Problem 1: Note:g is a function from Rⁿ to Rⁿ

Part 1: Should be straightforward. Think about x converging to the fixed point.

Part 2: Write your answer in terms of J_n the Jacobian of g at x_n and J_0 the Jacobian of g at x_0 and the Identity.

Hint: What is the Jacobian of the function x->x-inv(J0)*g(x) at x=x_n.  That is the matrix you need to write down.

Hint: You may use the fact that if x0 -x* is small then J0≈Jn≈J*.

Part 4: Remember that the eigenvalues of  αM are  α times the eigenvalues of M, and the problem says the eigenvalues are positive.
